# CSE476 Project

## Garmnt
Garmnt will change the way you dress.

## Description
Garmnt is an innovative mobile application designed to revolutionize the way you dress. By allowing you to upload images of your own clothing items, Garmnt gives you the power to effortlessly create and explore outfit combinations with a simple tap.

## Installation
To try Garmnt, download the files to your local device and open the project using Android Studio. Perform a Gradle sync and run the app. If when you run the app for the first time the camera does not open to upload new items, click Device Explorer -> Storage -> Emulated -> 0 -> Android -> data -> msu.cse476.hakalaja.project -> Files and then add a new folder named "Pictures". The camera is likely not opening because the app fails to create a temporary file to store the image in because the directory does not exist.
